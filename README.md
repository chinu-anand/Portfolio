# Personal Portfolio

It's my personal portfolio build using **React.js** with **SCSS** for frontend and **Sanity** for backend. Also **framer-motion** and **react-icons** are used for beautiful experience.

To run this on your system, first clone the repository in your machine and then run this -

## Install Sanity for backend -
```
cd Portfolio
cd backend_react
npm install
sanity start
```
now as backend have been installed and running properly ,now move to frontend.
## Install React.js and others for frontend -

```
cd Portfolio
cd frontend_react
npm install
npm start
```
